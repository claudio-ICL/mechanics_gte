This repository stores an implementation of the quantitative execution strategies described in my article 
Claudio Bellani & Damiano Brigo (2020) Mechanics of good trade execution in the framework of linear temporary market impact, Quantitative Finance, DOI: 10.1080/14697688.2020.1814395
([Mechanics of Good Trade Execution in the Framework of Linear Temporary Market Impact](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/D8DBAZSJEN5GV8JAPC9M/full?target=10.1080/14697688.2020.1814395))

The code is written in Python and utilises [Cython](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/quickstart/overview.html) in some computationally-intensive segments.
