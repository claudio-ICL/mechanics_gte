Available information on, or predictions of, the price at a future time are included as a constraint on the process. Both continuous-time and discrete models are analyzed. For the case in which the predicted future price is normal or Gaussian we obtain good estimates of the optimal stopping strategy and expected gain. A significant conclusion is that the nature of the optimal strategy can be very sensitive to the relative variance of the predicted future price.},

Moreover, we derive an explicit singular optimal strategy for the special case of an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck signal and an exponentially decaying transient market impact. The combination of a mean-reverting signal along with a market impact decay is of special interest, since they affect the short term price variations in opposite directions. Later, we show that in the asymptotic limit where the transient market impact becomes instantaneous, the optimal strategy becomes continuous. This result is compatible with the optimal trading framework which was proposed by Cartea and Jaimungal (Appl. Math. Finance 20:512–547, 2013). In order to support our models, we analyse nine months of tick-by-tick data on 13 European stocks from the NASDAQ OMX exchange. We show that order book imbalance is a predictor of the future price move and has some mean-reverting properties. From this data, we show that market participants, especially high-frequency traders, use this signal in their trading strategies.},

	abstract = {Using the CRSP (Center for Research in Security Prices) daily stock return data, we revisit the question of whether or not actual stock market prices exhibit long-range dependence. Our study is based on an empirical investigation reported in Teverovsky, Taqqu and Willinger [33] of the modified rescaled adjusted range or R/S statistic that was proposed by Lo [17] as a test for long-range dependence with good robustness properties under “extra” short-range dependence. Our main conclusion is that because the modified R/S statistic shows a strong preference for accepting the null hypothesis of no long-range dependence, irrespective of whether long-range dependence is present in the data or not, Lo's acceptance of the hypothesis for the CRSP data (i.e., no long-range dependence in stock market prices) is less conclusive than is usually regarded in the econometrics literature. In fact, upon further analysis of the data, we find empirical evidence of long-range dependence in stock price returns, but because the corresponding degree of long-range dependence (measured via the Hurst parameter H ) is typically very low (i.e., H -values around 0.60), the evidence is not absolutely conclusive.},

Given a volume-to-trade, fixed time horizon and discrete trading periods, the aim is to adapt a given volume trajectory such that it is dynamic with respect to favourable/unfavourable conditions during realtime execution, thereby improving overall cost of trading. We consider the standard Almgren-Chriss model with linear price impact as a candidate base model. This model is popular amongst sell-side institutions as a basis for arrival price benchmark execution algorithms. By training a learning agent to modify a volume trajectory based on the market's prevailing spread and volume dynamics, we are able to improve post-trade implementation shortfall by up to 10.3% on average compared to the base model, based on a sample of stocks and trade sizes in the South African equity market.},

	abstract = {Execution traders know that market impact greatly depends on whether their orders lean with or against the market. We introduce the OEH model, which incorporates this fact when determining the optimal trading horizon for an order, an input required by many sophisticated execution strategies. This model exploits the trader's private information about her trade's side and size, and how it will shift the prevailing order flow. From a theoretical perspective, OEH explains why market participants may rationally “dump” their orders in an increasingly illiquid market. We argue that trade side and order imbalance are key variables needed for modeling market impact functions, and their dismissal may be the reason behind the apparent disagreement in the literature regarding the functional form of the market impact function. We show that in terms of its information ratio OEH performs better than participation rate schemes and VWAP strategies. Our backtests suggest that OEH contributes substantial “execution alpha” for a wide variety of futures contracts. An implementation of OEH is provided in Python language.},

	abstract = {We examine optimal execution models that take into account both market microstructure impact and informational costs. Informational footprint is related to order flow and is represented by the trader's influence on the flow imbalance process, while microstructure influence is captured by instantaneous price impact. We propose a continuous-time stochastic control problem that balances between these two costs. Incorporating order flow imbalance leads to the consideration of the current market state and specifically whether one's orders lean with or against the prevailing order flow, key components often ignored by execution models in the literature. In particular, to react to changing order flow, we endogenize the trading horizon $T$. After developing the general indefinite-horizon formulation, we investigate several tractable approximations that sequentially optimize over price impact and over $T$. These approximations, especially a dynamic version based on receding horizon control, are shown to be very accurate and connect to the prevailing Almgren--Chriss framework, as well as features of empirical order flow, and the model presented in Optimal Execution Horizon by Easley, Lopez de Prado, and O'Hara [ Math.

These prices permit an equilibrium valuation of assets with uncertain payoffs at many future dates. Furthermore, for any given portfolio, the price of a $1.00 claim received at a future date, if the portfolio's value is between two given levels at that time, is derived explicitly from a second partial derivative of its call-option pricing function. An intertemporal capital asset pricing model is derived for payoffs that are jointly lognormally distributed with aggregate consumption. It is shown that using the Black-Scholes equation for options on aggregate consumption implies that individuals' preferences aggregate to isoelastic utility.},

Moreover, the option hedging strategy computed under the assumption of the misspecified volatility provides an almost sure one‐sided hedge for the option under the true volatility. Analogous results hold if the true volatility dominates the misspecified volatility. These comparisons can fail, however, if the misspecified volatility is not assumed to be a function of time and the stock price.

Using this principle, a theoretical valuation formula for options is derived. Since almost all corporate liabilities can be viewed as combinations of options, the formula and the analysis that led to it are also applicable to corporate liabilities such as common stock, corporate bonds, and warrants.

	abstract={In the present paper we construct stock-price processes with the same marginal lognormal law as that of a geometric Brownian motion and also with the same transition density (and returns' distributions) between any two instants in a given discrete-time grid. We then illustrate how option prices based on such processes differ from Black and Scholes', in that option prices can assume any value in-between the no-arbitrage lower and upper bounds. We also explain that this is due to the particular way one models the stock-price process in between the grid time instants that are relevant for trading. The findings of the paper are inspired by a theoretical result, linking density-evolution of diffusion processes to exponential families. Such result is briefly reviewed in an appendix.},

	abstract={We investigate, in a fairly general setting, the limit of large volume equilibrium Gibbs measures for elasticity type Hamiltonians with clamped boundary conditions. The existence of a quasiconvex free energy, forming the large deviations rate functional, is shown using a new interpolation lemma for partition functions. The local behaviour of the Gibbs measures can be parametrized by Young measures on the space of gradient Gibbs measures. In view of the unboundedness of the state space, the crucial tool here is an exponential tightness estimate that holds for a vast class of potentials and the construction of suitable compact sets of gradient Gibbs measures.},
